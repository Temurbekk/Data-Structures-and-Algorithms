What are Trees?
    Trees are a nonlinear Data Structure.
    They contain nodes and if a node is pointing to anothe node, the node that it is pointing to is called a child node and the node that is pointing at a child node is called a parent node
What are Binary Trees?
    Variation of Trees
    Type of a tree that parent nodes can hold at most 2 nodes.
What are Binary Search Trees?
    Variation of a Binary Trees
    All of the children to the left of the root/parent should be less than and all of the children to the right should be greater than the root/parent
Time complexity of a BTS
    Insertion is O(log n) in the average case
    Searching is O(log n) in the average case
    BFS is O(n) in the average case
    DFS is O(n) in the average case
Space complexity of a BTS
    BFS is O(n) in all cases
        Where n is the number of nodes(Each node is visited once)
    DFS is O(n) in all cases
        Where n is the number of nodes(Each node is visited once)
