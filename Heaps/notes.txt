What is a binary heap?
    It should be compact(balanced)
    There are two different types of binary heaps
        MaxBinaryHeap - parent nodes are always larger than the child nodes
        MinBinaryHeap - parent nodes are always smaller than the child nodes
How to find the children of a nodes 
    To find the left child, you need to use the formula 2n+1 where 'n' is the index the parent is located
    To find the right child, you need to use the formula 2n+2 where 'n' is the index the parent is located
How to find the parent of a nodes
    To find the parent of a node, you need to use the formula(n-1)/2(take the floor) where 'n' is the location of the child node
How to insert into a MaxBinaryHeap?
    You add it to the end and bubble up by comparing its value to its parent
Time complexity of a binary heap
    It is O(log n) for both insertion and deletion
    It is O(n) when searching for an element in a heap


What is a priority queue?
    Priority queue is a data structure where the node with the most priority gets called first.
    If there is a choice between shifting a node with priority one or priority two, priority 1 will be called first considering we are working with a min heap
Why use Heap to implement priority queue?
    the min and max properties of a heap helps us extract the node with at most priority.
Time complexity of Priority queue
    It is O(log n) for both insertion and deletion.
