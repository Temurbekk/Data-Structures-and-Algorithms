What is a hash function?
    It is a data structure that help inserting and retreiving in to take constant time.
What makes a good hashing function?
    Good hashing function eliminates as much colision as possible
    It makes sense when you read it.
What are collisions?
    collisions happen when two elements produce same index after using the has function
How to handle collisions?
    There are two ways of handling collisions 
        Separate Chaining - It store the element in the same index by storing the elements in a bigger array where bigger array holds the elements that were inserted in the current index
            Downside - Working with too many arrays within array may be tricky
        Linear Probing - It looks for the next available slot in the array to place the elements
            Downside- you can hold at most the arra.length number of elements in your hash table

Time Complexity of the HashTables
    Insertion is O(1)
    Deletion is O(1)
    Accessing is O(1)
