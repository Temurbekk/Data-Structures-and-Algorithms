What is a linked list?
    Linked List is a linear data structure that allows you to store data
    Linked List is useful because as oppose to Arrays, it does not have a specific length and it allows users to add data or remove data without moving the whole structure
    Although, it may be tricky at times to add or remove data from a linked list, it is more efficient
What is a Singly Linked List?
    Singly Linked List are lists that can point to the node next to them, they do not have a property to look at the node that is pointing at them
    It doesn't have a potential to go back in a list

Downsides of a Singly Linked List is that cannot point backward
