What are stacks?
    Stacks are a linear data structure that follows the rules of LIFO(Last In First Out)
        Where the last inserted item gets removed first.
    The stacks can be visalised as a stack of books, where the last book you places will be removed first.

How to use stacks?
    Since arrays in Javascript have methods push(), pop() you can treat the JS arrays as stack
    You can also create your own Stack class using Linked Lists but why do that when you can use an arrays

Why use stacks?
    Stacks are used in many different applications and some of the examples are:
        To find if a string is a paindrome
        A typical method for matching parenthesis problem
        And much more that involve the ruled of LIFO

Complexities:
    Time Complexity: 
        Adding: O(1)
        Removing: O(1)
        Searching: O(n)
        Accessing: O(n)
        
    Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements stored in a stack
