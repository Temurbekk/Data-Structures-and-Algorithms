What is dynamic programming?
    A method of solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those problems just once, and storing their solutions(into an array)
    Using a past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier

What are Overlapping Subproblems?
    A problem is set to have Overlapping Subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times 
    One example of Overlapping Subproblems is calculating Nth Fibonacci number
What is Optimal Substructure?
    A problem is set to have Optimal Subproblems if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
    The best solution for Fibonacci of 5 depends on Fibonacci of 4 and Fibonacci 3
What is Memoization?(TOP-DOWN)
    Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same input occurs again
What is Tabulation?(BOTTOM-UP)
    Storing the result of a previous result in a 'table'(usually an array)
    Usually done by iteration
    It has better space complexity compared to Memoization because you are not storing data in call stack
    With bigger numbers, it will handle problems with exceeded call stack error caused by recursion
