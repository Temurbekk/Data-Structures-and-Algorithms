What is Insertion Sort?
    As it traverses through an array, it picks one element and decided where it should insert it depending on what should come before and what should come after
    We use 2 for loops to itterate through an array.
        One loop goes from start to finish while the other loops works backwards 
    
Time Complexity is O(n^2)
Space Complexity is O(1)
