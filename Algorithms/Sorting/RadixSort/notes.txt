What is Radix Sort?
    Warning!!
        This sort requires a lot of math!!
    We never compare two numbers
    It only works on numbers 
    It looks at the last digit of a number and places it in a bucket of 0-9 and puts it back to the array
    Then it looks at one digit to the left and places it in the bucket of 0-9 and puts it back to the array
    It keep doing this operation until it compares all the digits in the largest number

    note:
        It sees which numbers have the most digits and assumes they are larger than the ones with fewer digits
Time Complexity
