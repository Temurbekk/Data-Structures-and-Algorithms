What is a Binary Search?(array has to be sorted for this to work)
    Binary Search takes an input array and checks if the middle element is less than or greater than the target
    We mainly work with 3 variables: 
        start - where the array starts(index 0)
        end - where the array ends(index arr.length-1)
        middle - (start+end)/2
    If the target is less than the middle, it will assign the end variable to be middle and perform the same operation
    If the target is greater than the middle, it will assign the start variable to be the middle and perform the same operation
