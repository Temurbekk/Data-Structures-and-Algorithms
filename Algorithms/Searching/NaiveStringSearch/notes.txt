Naive String Search
    It will find how many times did one small string occur in a bigger string

Example:
    We want to find how many times does a work 'omg' occur in 'omg this is so awesme omg i love programming omg'
    We find out that the specific combination of characters occur 3 times.
    
Time Complexity O(n^2)
Space Complexity O(1)
