What are graphs?
    Graphs are a data structure that have edged connecting to one another using verteces.
    Graphs can be directed or undirected.
Directed Graphs
    Directed graphs are usually represented using arrows.
    In directed graphs, you can move from one node to another if the first node has an arrow pointing toward the second node
Undirected Graphs
    Undirected graphs are usually represented using line segments
    In undirected Graphs, you can traverse from one node to another back and forth without any trouble

Weighted Graphs
    Weighted Graphs are graphs with 'weight' on their vertecies
    This is used to find the shortest path or the time traveled from one edge to another

Adjacency List
    Takes less space
    Faster to itterate over all edges 
    Can be slower to lookup a specific edge
Adjacency Matrix
    Takes up more space
    Slower to itterate over all edges
    Faster to lookup a specific edge

Time complexity depending if Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix is used

    Operation       Adjacency List  Adjacency Matrix
    Add Vertex      O(1)            O(|V^2|)
    Add Edge        O(1)            O(1)
    Remove Vertex   O(|V| + |E|)    O(|V^2|)
    Remove Edge     O(|E|)          O(1)
    Lookup          O(|V| + |E|)    O(1)
    Storage         O(|V| + |E|)    O(|V^2|)
